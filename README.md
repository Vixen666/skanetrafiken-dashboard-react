# Skånetrafiken Dashboard
This site displays the next upcomming departures from up to four choosen busstops in Skåne using Skånetrafikens API (http://www.labs.skanetrafiken.se/).
The current weather and a forecast for the next upcomming 15 hours is also shown, along a digital clock. 

## Usage
The developers ideé was to have this site on an always on display in his hallway so that he easily could see when the next bus departures. 

## Installation
1.  Git clone https://github.com/Vixen666/skanetrafiken-dashboard-react/
2.  cd skanetrafiken-dashboard-react
3.  npm install
4.  npm start
5.  Allow CORS. Since no backend is developed and skånetrafiken isnt allowing cors this needs to be enabled from the client-side. For chrome there's alot of plugins, like https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf

## Reason for React

Even thou both Angular and Vue.js is growing and taking larger larger marketshares React is still the leading Framework for web-developing [1]. I have some former knowlegde about React and Redux, doing a project once before. But that time we took over a half done project, so this is the first time setting up a React project from scratch!
